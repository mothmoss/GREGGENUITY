**Highlights**
Rebalanced AE2.
    Notably, aspects of it are locked behind Fluixsteel - requiring Chrome. 
    While still obtainable at LV through tiny dusts, its intended to be set up around MV-HV as opposed to the second you get voltage.
    This is because in playtesting I found that it was in a really awkward spot. I think this will fit better.
Moved to Galacticraft over Advanced Rocketry.
    This is a decision motivated by three things. 
    One - I prefer the linear progression of Galacticraft. I had planned on mimicking a similar system with warp artifacts, but it felt janky in practice.
    Two - I prefer the visuals of Galacticraft.
    Three - most importantly, I prefer how intuitive Galacticraft is. 
Restructured MaterialIDs massively.
