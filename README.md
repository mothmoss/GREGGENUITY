# GREGGENUITY


Greggenuity (GGN), returned from the dead!
A pack with a focus on creating a comprehensive, well-integrated and unique GregTech experience: with changes made to standard progression and all other mods present in the pack well-integrated into progression.

Greggenuity features entirely optional magic that's been Greggified - screws and plates in every recipe, and a healthy heaping of magichem. The pack is in its early stages right now and isn't quite ready for a release, but is rapidly being devleoped.
